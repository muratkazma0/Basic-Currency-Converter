# Basic Currency Converter
 This Python script utilizes the requests module to interact with the ExchangeRate-API for currency conversion. Users input the source and target currencies, along with the amount they wish to exchange. The script then retrieves the latest exchange rates from the API and performs the conversion, displaying the result to the user.
